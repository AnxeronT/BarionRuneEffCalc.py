Barion's Rune Effiiciency Calculator, ported to Python for learning purposes.

Foreword
---
This is just for learning purposes. That said, the data and values for the calculation may not be up-to-date, or even be outright wrong. 
Other websites exists and does a way better/accurate job than this piece of code. However, you are free to learn from this code, but don't expect a good linting practice to exist.

Honestly, I don't know why I made a repository here anyways. I may work on it more to allow for more complex handling of data(spreadsheet or a import/export codes)[again, for learning purposes], but don't expect any updates on this.
